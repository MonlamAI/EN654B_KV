A Verse of Aspiration to the Lord of Sages Together with the Sixteen Arhats Oṃ svasti prajebhyaḥ. O lord of the ten strengths, victorious Ādityabandhu, Together with your entourage of regents, the arhats- Through your amṛta blessings radiating throughout the world, May the lotus of well-being and happiness forever bloom! This is a supplication by Khyentse Wangpo, a monk of Lord Śākya and servant who pleases Guru Mañjughoṣa. Siddhirastu.
